# Ubuntu Dataset Topic Modelling

We performed topic modelling of the Ubuntu Dataset, which is a large corpus of multi-turn chat dialogues between users and tech supports for Ubuntu OS related issues. We experimented with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). After evaluation, we determined that LSA had the best performance metrics. We then built a topic detector using LSA to generate a set of relevant topics for a given tech support conversation.
